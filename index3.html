In their seven Ivy games, they outscored opponents by 143 points, an average margin of victory of over 20 points. Meanwhile, Harvard—Columbia’s co-champion—only outscored opponents by 83 points. </p> <div class="graphic"> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The team featured a relentless running attack led by three elite backs—O’Connor, Haggerty, and Warren—who never failed to deliver. The trio combined for over 172 rushing yards per game and accounted for over 20 touchdowns that season. Their effectiveness was reinforced by the strength of the offensive line, which featured three all-Ivy Leaguers. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> While Columbia’s offense got most of the attention, its defense was outstanding as well. The Lions held opponents to only 13 points per game on 212.7 yards per game, indicating a rock-solid defense. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The 1961 team still dominates Columbia’s record books. Seven of its seniors were named to Columbia’s All-150 team. Additionally, the Lions’ 50 points in their 50-0 thrashing of Brown still holds the record for the most points scored against an Ivy opponent in Columbia history, and their 6-1 Ivy League record remains the winningest Ivy season Columbia has ever had. The team was inducted into the Columbia Athletics Hall of Fame in 2010. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Yet none of the Lions’ successes would have happened without their veteran leaders, namely Campbell. Campbell spearheaded a movement that made winning a priority in the football program, enforcing the team’s 10:30 p.m. curfew and bringing a new level of intensity to practices. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Even after graduation, Campbell was the glue that kept the team together. According to O’Donnell, the late Campbell would organize get-togethers with his former teammates, covering the airfare and other costs for those who did not have the financial means to attend. </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/AG2XENKVMNG2NJ6LLODDZPUAUY.jpg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> <span class="image-credit"> Image courtesy of Columbia Athletics </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Campbell and Waldbaum developed a close relationship at Columbia that continued through their adult lives, with Campbell never failing to thank Waldbaum for his support of the team. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “[Campbell] was an extraordinary human being,” Waldbaum said. “He had this ability to make everybody around him feel that they were part of the team. It transcended the mere playing of football for him.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> For many of the 1961 Lions, the relationships they formed are what they cherish the most about that season. O’Donnell recalls Donelli telling him many years after 1961, “You know, one thing about your whole group is that you always supported one another.” </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/VN2WMKQGFBAGHFBYKCP7QBH744.jpeg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> <span class="image-credit"> Image courtesy of Columbia Athletics </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “What has stuck with me the most over the past 60 years has been the friendships and camaraderie over six decades,” Vasell said. “We first met each other as freshmen in 1958. We rode the bus to Baker Field every day to and from practice, and we forged a bond over a common love of football.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Playing on the 1961 team meant more than just winning Columbia’s first Ivy League football championship; it was a transformative experience that helped the players transition to life after Columbia. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Being a part of something, having to work physically very hard to do it, and to put up a disappointment but still have a successful outcome ... teaches you a lot about things in general, in terms of saying, ‘OK, things didn’t work, but you overcome it. You make success the next week.’ That’s a lesson that’s good in any part of life,” Warren said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Many of the players from the 1961 team still follow Columbia football closely. Warren, who has been a team doctor for the New York Giants for the past 35 years, said he goes to games each season. Sometimes, he also recommends players on whom he operates to look into Columbia. </p> <p class="g-body subhed">The second title</p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Sixty years later, the Lions are still on the hunt for that elusive second title. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “At this juncture, I am a little surprised that Columbia has not won another Ivy League football championship,” Vasell said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The Lions got close in 2017. Their 5-2 Ivy League record was the best in recent memory, but it was not enough to win the conference. It is difficult to pinpoint an exact reason for such a long drought, but Warren has some hypotheses. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Columbia’s never been known as a real football school in general, so those kinds of records are sort of self-perpetuating just from a recruiting point of view,” Warren said. “It’s very easy for other schools to tell recruits, ‘Well, why do you really want to go there if you’re not gonna win a lot of games?’” </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/3NDQMLYLERG27FY4JLNHVUIZGU.jpg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> <span class="image-credit"> Image courtesy of Columbia Athletics </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> While the 1961 Lions belong to an exclusive club that consists of only them, many long for the day when their alma mater will be able to repeat their success. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Quite frankly, I’m tired of hearing about the ’61 team or the last three winning seasons and stuff like that,” O’Donnell said. “That’s not something that should be saluted. That’s something that should be considered an embarrassment.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “It’s time we started talking about the class of 2022 winning the title,” he added. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Yet there is reason for optimism. Warren, O’Donnell, and Waldbaum are all strong believers in head coach Al Bagnoli, who won nine Ivy League titles at the helm of Penn’s program. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I think [Bagnoli], who in my view is the smartest coach there since Buff, [has] a shot,” O’Donnell said. “I don’t think anybody wants him to succeed more than the group that was there when I was there.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The Lions have started the year 3-1, their only loss coming in their <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/sports/2021/10/02/princeton-pulls-away-in-fourth-quarter-to-give-lions-first-loss-of-season/">Ivy opener</a> against Princeton. With a full slate of Ivy League games ahead of them, their potential to win the title will soon be put to the test. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> This year’s squad also shares several similarities with the 1961 team. Led by seniors Dante Miller and Ryan Young, the Lions possess a fierce rushing attack with multiple options, much like the running core of O’Connor, Haggerty, and Warren. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The Light Blue’s 10 fifth-year “super seniors” have provided veteran leadership, paralleling the 1961 team’s nucleus of senior leaders, and just like the 1961 team, this year’s Lions were tested by a strong Princeton squad early in the season. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “If you look at the schedule, you could have a similar thing from 1961,” Waldbaum said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> With a plethora of young talent on the roster—including sophomore quarterback <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/sports/2021/09/28/he-didnt-want-to-be-promised-anything-joe-greens-path-to-columbias-starting-quarterback-role/">Joe Green</a> and a junior varsity squad that is tearing through opponents—the Lions may not be far from their second title. But until then, the 1961 team will remain Columbia’s one and only champion. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Deputy Sports Editor Matt Kim can be contacted at </i><a href="mailto:matt.kim@columbiaspectator.com"><i>matt.kim@columbiaspectator.com</i></a><i>.
