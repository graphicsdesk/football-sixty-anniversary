Somewhere in Lakeside, Connecticut, Tom Vasell, CC ’62—one of the Ivy League’s most prolific passers—had just gone through a grueling football practice. After his eighth practice in four days, Vasell’s entire body was aching. It was a feeling the New Jersey native knew well. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Camp Columbia, the football team’s annual preseason training camp, was in full swing. Entering his third and final season on the varsity squad, Vasell was used to both the pain of two-a-days and the pain of losing seasons. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “We had all done this before,” he said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> After practice, Vasell and his teammates would drink a concoction made by assistant coach John Toner to recharge. It was made of cider, water, vinegar, and honey—“bug juice,” they called it. It was not glorious, but it did the job for Vasell. However, he thirsted for something even sweeter—his first taste of victory. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Columbia had been one of the least successful teams in the Ivy League since the conference’s formalization in 1954. The Lions had not finished in the top half of the Ancient Eight in five years; they had earned only four conference wins in the last two seasons combined. Still, led by a talented group of seniors—including Vasell; halfback Russ Warren, CC ’62; captain and left guard Bill Campbell, CC ’62; and all-Ivy tackle Bob Asack, CC ’62—Columbia possessed a sense of optimism which seemed out of place for a team that had finished dead last in the Ivy League only two years prior. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “We’re victory-hungry,” Vasell said in a 1961 preseason interview with Spectator. “The fellows realize that this is our last chance to win a whole lot of football games.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Three years earlier, these seniors were first-years competing for Columbia’s “Cub team.” At the time, first-years were not eligible to play varsity football. Instead, they played a five-game season against other first-year teams from across the conference. The uncharacteristically large 1958 Cub squad, specially brought in by head coach Aldo “Buff” Donelli to eventually build the varsity squad into a winning program, had high expectations entering the season. Vasell remembers his coaches riled the team up in preseason workouts with the slogan, “Let’s go, five and oh!” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The young Cubs had good reason for their confidence. Donelli recruited a talented group, which according to Vasell, had three quarterbacks jostling for the starting job and “big, stout linemen who were bigger than most varsity players.” Warren even recalls embarrassing the varsity team in a scrimmage. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I think it was the last time they scrimmaged us because we actually dominated the game,” he said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The team did not deliver on its coaches’ hopes of going undefeated, but it still turned in a winning 3-2 record—“unheard of” for Columbia football, according to Vasell. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “[As first-years], we knew that Columbia had not done well, and we thought that we should try to establish ourselves as being potentially a good team in the future,” Warren said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> While the first-years were turning heads with their impressive play, the varsity squad was solidifying itself as one of the Ivy League’s bottomfeeders. In 1958, the Lions went 1-6 in Ivy play, better only than a winless Yale team. The following year, many members of the ’58 Cub team, now sophomores, moved up to the varsity squad. Yet success on the field was still hard to come by. In 1959, the Lions again won a lone Ivy League game, and in 1960, they won only three. </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/WZHBY65AFZELLLAHT3EQINXSZ4.jpg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> <span class="image-credit"> Image courtesy of Columbia Athletics </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “We were young guys bucking against some very good competition, and it was tough,” Vasell said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Given Columbia’s historic woes, those outside the team expected nothing better from the Lions ahead of the 1961 season. Outsiders anticipated that Donelli’s squad would have yet another subpar showing, with preseason polls projecting a sixth-place conference finish for the Light Blue. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Stanley Waldbaum, CC ’62, the then-sports editor of Spectator, wrote before the season, “If practically no one gets hurt, if a few key sophomores come through, and most important of all, if Buff Donelli’s nineteen experienced seniors get fighting mad, then no Ivy League squad will have a chance against the Lions. But if not, then once again, Columbia will be doomed to the dreary depths of the second division.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In a league where senior experience reigned supreme, the class of ’62 hoped that their time to run the show was coming that year. But before the Lions could take such a big leap, something else would need to happen. Namely, they would need to create an environment where the team’s success came before individual fun. At the time, “the concept that a bunch of players or starters would go out and have 20 beers on a Saturday night was not a weird concept,” Joe O’Donnell, CC ’64, said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “During several past seasons morale on the Columbia squad was not very high,” Waldbaum wrote that season. “Often its leaders were unable to stem the rash of curfew-breakings and half-hearted practice performances of the third and fourth stringers and this would soon affect the whole team.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In essence, the team needed to surmount “an old culture of accepting losing,” as Vasell put it. </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/BSGSL3PFUNFUTMVEASAFK6Z3FA.jpg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> <span class="image-credit"> Image courtesy of Columbia Athletics </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Their plan to overcome such a deep tradition? </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “A combination of a lot of senior leadership and then a terrific captain in the form of <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/sports/2019/11/21/bill-campbell-gave-columbia-his-time-and-money-but-his-biggest-gift-was-generations-of-mentorship/">Bill Campbell</a>.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Campbell—who earned the nickname “Ballsie Campbell” in his Cub days—and the other seniors took on what seemed to be an impossible task: setting a standard of discipline and accountability, which shaped everything from practice intensity to nightlife. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Campbell, Donelli, and assistant coach Don Savini, were key figures in enforcing the team’s 10:30 p.m. curfew, which had not been adhered to in the past. Not only that, he and the other seniors decided to create a no-partying policy during the season. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “We just all took the game seriously,” O’Donnell said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> This level of intensity translated to the practice field, too. The team came out of Camp Columbia “in terrific condition”—especially crucial in an era when players played on both offense and defense and the number of game substitutions was limited. Despite the Lions’ struggles over the previous years, “We all felt we could win,” Warren said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The players’ confidence was only reinforced when they went back home to Morningside Heights after Camp Columbia and handled Bucknell University 18-8 in a preseason scrimmage. Still, the Lions were not satisfied. In a break from tradition, Campbell convinced his teammates to return to Camp Columbia for extra training ahead of their Ivy opener. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “We’re ready,” Campbell told Spectator in 1961. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> It seemed like the perfect storm. Columbia had one of the Ivy League’s best quarterbacks in Vasell; an explosive backfield consisting of Warren, junior Tom O’Connor, CC ’63, and senior Tom Haggerty, CC ’62; and all-Ivy linemen in Campbell, Asack, and senior Tony Day, CC ’62. </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/4O6ON6SCTJGTLCOMSYC2JJOIKU.jpg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> <span class="image-credit"> Image courtesy of Columbia Athletics </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> To put the cherry on top, Donelli was a legendary coach with even more legendary life experiences. He had coached in the National Football League, played soccer for the U.S. men’s national team, and served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. With these myriad experiences to draw from, Donelli was a fitting leader for a group that hungered to experience success for the first time. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Buff was extremely smart, maybe one of the smartest people I have ever met,” O’Donnell said. “He had a great perspective on human nature.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Vasell echoed this sentiment: “He knew how to handle men.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> With a strong nucleus of seniors, an unwavering belief in their abilities, and a hunger to achieve what they never had, the Lions were ready to take on the Ivy League. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> First up: Brown. </p> </div> <div class="footer g-body"> <div class="article-credits"> <p> Produced with <a href="https://github.com/graphicsdesk/spectate">Spectate</a> by the <a href="https://graphicsdesk.github.io">Spectator Graphics</a> team. </p> </div> </div> <script src="https://spectator-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/football-sixty-anniversary/script.75da7f30.js"></script> </div> </body></html>
